  So let us say the current day of the month is 30th August
  The person's birthday is on the 31st August. 

  30 - 31 = -1 days

  We need to borrow the days from the previous month to calculate the difference in days between the two dates. 

  We can get the previous date by doing new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 0). The 0 there will ensure we will get the previous month's date on the last day, which as of now is Monday, July, 31st. 

  We can use the getDate() method on the previous month last date to obtain the number of days for the previous month.
